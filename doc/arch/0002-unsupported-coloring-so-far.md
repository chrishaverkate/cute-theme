# 2. Unsupported coloring so far

Date: 2020-09-05

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Some tokens are not parsed by VSCode, which makes certain tokens undifferentiable.

## Decision

Add grammar injection(s) to support additional tokens or tokenization:
* Added C/CPP grammar injection for doxygen inline comments

  Copied an existing TextMate rule from the VSCode project and made a slight modification to it [5]. This rule takes
  precedence over the existing rule, broadening the applicability of documentation tokens.

These tokens are not differentiable by default, so they cannot be colored as desired:
* To be revisited

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
